# Filter Bubbles in Recommender Systems
This study examines the impact of user choices and algorithmic recommendations on the formation of filter bubbles in movie recommendation systems. We conducted an extensive literature review, presenting a formal definition of filter bubbles and summarizing the most critical studies on the topic.

We then performed a simulation study using a collaborative filtering recommendation system trained on the MovieLens dataset. This study evaluates the impact of both algorithmic recommendations and user choices on narrowing content exposure. In the second part of the paper, we propose a method to compute the average treatment effect of following recommendations on the homogeneity of future recommendations and watch history.

Our results show that the algorithm plays an 80% role in the formation of inter-user filter bubbles, while the user plays a limited but still significant 20% role.
